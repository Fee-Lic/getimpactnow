Digital technologies have transformed the way we live and work. They’ve
revolutionised industries as diverse as media, retail, education and financial
services. In some cases, digital technologies have disrupted whole industries –
forcing companies to forge new business models and develop new service
offerings. In other industries, such as financial services and retail, while the
business model has remained broadly the same, digital tools have transformed the
customer experience. Changes in the social field have been equally dramatic.
Think of education; remote learning is reshaping the higher education landscape,
offering access to some of the world’s best universities to anyone with a laptop
and internet connection.
