## Quick intro about Nesta

Digital technologies have transformed the way we live and work. They’ve
revolutionised industries as diverse as media, retail, education and financial
services. In some cases, digital technologies have disrupted whole industries –
forcing companies to forge new business models and develop new service
offerings. In other industries, such as financial services and retail, while the
business model has remained broadly the same, digital tools have transformed the
customer experience. Changes in the social field have been equally dramatic.
Think of education; remote learning is reshaping the higher education landscape,
offering access to some of the world’s best universities to anyone with a laptop
and internet connection.

## Build On The Internet. No Dependencies.

The Internet Computer extends the public Internet so it can natively host
websites, software systems, open internet services and DeFi. It is created by
independent data centers worldwide running the ICP protocol.

## What are we building

The Policy of the Future is Made by All of Us. We ([get.impact.now][gin]) is
building a digital Platform which enables responsible Citizen to Be Part of the
Decision-Making Process.

As such a Platform must not be controlled by any central party, we'll build it
on the natural evolution of the internet called the Internet Computer (IC). The
IC is build by a [Foundation called DFINITY](https://dfinity.org/foundation):

DFINITYs mission is:

> ... to build The Internet Computer, thereby reinventing the Internet as a
> computer that hosts secure software with superpowers. The Internet Computer is
> a new technology stack that is unhackable, fast, scales to billions of users
> around the world, and supports a new kind of autonomous software that promises
> to reverse Big Tech’s monopolization of the internet.
